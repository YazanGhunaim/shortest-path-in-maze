# Installation

To run this program, you will need to have the Qt framework installed on your computer. You can download Qt from the official website: https://www.qt.io/download.

Once you have Qt installed, you can clone this repository and open the project in Qt Creator. Then, you can build and run the program from within Qt Creator.

# Usage

When you run the program, you will see a window with two buttons: "Generate Maze" and "Find Path". Clicking the "Generate Maze" button will generate a new random maze. Clicking the "Find Path" button will solve the maze and display the shortest path from the start to the target.

The maze is displayed using a QGraphicsView widget. The walls of the maze are displayed in black, the open spaces are displayed in white, and the cells that are visited during the search are displayed in green.
